    "* Utilize a different and larger dataset to see if this model can be extended to other types of plagiarism.\n",
    "* Use language or character-level analysis to find different (and more) similarity features.\n",
    "* Write a complete pipeline function that accepts a source text and submitted text file, and classifies the submitted text as plagiarized or not.\n",
    "* Use API Gateway and a lambda function to deploy your model to a web application.\n",
    "\n",
